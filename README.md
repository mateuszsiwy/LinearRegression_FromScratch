# Linear Regression
This repository contains a file with my process of understanding most popular Linear Regression algorithms.
The ones i have processed are: Normal Equation, SVD, Batch Gradient Descend and Stochastic Gradient Descent
## Pros and Cons of these algorithms
All of these algorithms have their proffesional appliance, The simplest one is Normal Equation, its easy to understand, but it performs poorly on data sets with a lot of features. 
Next we have SVD, its more efficent that Normal Equation, but also performs poorly when the number of features is large.
After that there are 2 versions of Gradient Descent, Batch also struggles with large data sets, as it performs operations on the whole data at once, 
on the other hand Stochastic performs better on large data, due to randomly selecting one sample, and adjusting the cost accordingly
